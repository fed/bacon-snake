# Snake meets Bacon.js

Snake arcade game implementation in Bacon.js using ES6. This is a somewhat modified version of [Philip Nilsson's implementation](https://github.com/philipnilsson/Snake-Bacon). Most of the topics on [this tutorial](http://philipnilsson.github.io/badness/) still apply to this project.

## Building

Run `npm install` the first time you clone this project in order to fetch all the dependencies.

For development purposes, Grunt's default task will automatically watch all of your source files for changes, build the appropriate distribution files and refresh the page for you. To run start the app and the watch task, run `npm start`. The app will go live on [http://localhost:6789/](http://localhost:6789/).

To just build the app, run `npm run build` instead. You'll find the build files on the `dist` folder.
